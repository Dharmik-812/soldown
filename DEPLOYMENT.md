# Deployment Guide for SOLDOWN

## 🚀 Deployment on Vercel

This guide will help you deploy SOLDOWN on Vercel with proper configuration.

### Key Features Implemented

1. **PWA Support**: Can be installed as a mobile/web app
2. **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all screen sizes
3. **Vercel Compatible**: Uses `ytdl-core` for YouTube downloads (works on serverless)
4. **Offline Support**: Service Worker for caching

### Important Notes

#### ⚠️ Vercel Limitation

Due to Vercel's serverless architecture, the following limitations apply:

- **YouTube URLs**: Fully supported using `ytdl-core`
- **Other Platforms** (Vimeo, Twitter, Instagram, etc.): Not supported on Vercel
  - These require `yt-dlp` which needs a VPS or dedicated server

#### Recommended Deployment Options

1. **For YouTube Only**: Deploy to Vercel (free, easy)
2. **For Multiple Platforms**: Deploy to VPS/Dedicated Server (DigitalOcean, AWS EC2, etc.)

### Deployment Steps

#### Vercel Deployment

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed):
```bash
npm i -g vercel
```

2. **Deploy**:
```bash
vercel
```

3. **Or connect to GitHub** and push your code to automatically deploy

#### Environment Variables

No special environment variables needed for basic deployment.

### Testing

After deployment, test the following:

1. ✅ Open the website on mobile browser
2. ✅ Check "Add to Home Screen" prompt
3. ✅ Test YouTube video download
4. ✅ Verify mobile responsiveness
5. ✅ Test PWA installation

### Mobile App Installation

#### On Android:
1. Open in Chrome
2. Tap the menu (3 dots)
3. Select "Install app" or "Add to Home screen"

#### On iOS:
1. Open in Safari
2. Tap the Share button
3. Scroll and tap "Add to Home Screen"

### Troubleshooting

#### Download Not Working on Vercel

If downloads fail on Vercel:
- Ensure you're using YouTube URLs only
- Check the console for error messages
- Verify the `VERCEL` environment variable is detected

#### PWA Not Installing

- Ensure HTTPS is enabled (Vercel provides this automatically)
- Check that `manifest.json` is accessible
- Verify service worker registration in browser console

### Updating for Full Platform Support

To support all platforms (Vimeo, Twitter, etc.):

1. Deploy to a VPS or dedicated server
2. Install Node.js and required dependencies
3. The server will automatically detect non-serverless environment
4. Use `yt-dlp` for multi-platform support
